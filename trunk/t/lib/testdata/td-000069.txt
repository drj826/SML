description:: This is a description of my problem.  This purpose of
this problem is to serve as a test for applications designed to
process SML problem regions.

This is some narrative text within the problem region.  You can put as
much narrative text as you want inside regions but you may ~~not~~ use
sections.  The purpose of ~~this~~ paragraph is to test the parser to
see if it recognizes the end of the problem preamble which is also the
beginning of the problem narrative.
