* Introduction

This is the Test and Evaluation Document (TED) for the Structured
Manuscript Language (SML) data format and SML application library.

The purpose of this document is to:

+ describe the [g:sml:unit test case]s that verify [g:ieee:unit]s work
  properly

+ describe the verification [g:ieee:test case]s that verify
  [g:sml:requirement]s are satisfied

+ report [g:sml:unit test] results that demonstrate units are working
  properly

+ report [g:ieee:verification] test results that demonstrate
  requirements are satisfied
