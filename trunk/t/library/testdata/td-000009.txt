This SML document contains an 'insert' data element.  The 'insert'
statement tells an application to insert content collected somewhere
else in the document. The 'insert' statement in this test file inserts
a problem description.

SML allows you to insert definitions and narratives.  This test file
contains an example of each. A definition is the definition of a
glossary term.  A narrative is the narrative division of an
environment or region.
