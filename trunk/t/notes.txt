What about using 'divpart' where divpart is always either 'preamble'
or 'narrative'?

For that matter, since you can only be in one or the other, why not
have a boolean called 'in_preamble' to indicate whether you're
currently in the preamble of the deepest nested division?

A baretable is an environment with no preamble.

Cells cannot contain data elements.

Possible division types are:

- division
- document
- section
- region
- environment
- comment
- conditional
