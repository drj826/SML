description:: This is a description of my problem. This purpose of this problem is to serve as a test for applications designed to process SML problem regions.

This is some narrative text within the problem region. You can put as much narrative text as you want inside regions but you may ~~not~~ use sections. The purpose of ~~this~~ paragraph is to test the parser to see if it recognizes the end of the problem preamble which is also the beginning of the problem narrative.
