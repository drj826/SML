statement tells an application to insert content collected somewhere
else in the document. The 'insert' statement in this test file inserts
a problem description.

SML allows you to insert definitions and narratives.  This test file
contains an example of each. A definition is the definition of a
glossary term.  A narrative is the narrative division of an
