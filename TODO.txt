subtitle:: SML Library Bugs to Fix and Ideas to Implement

######################################################################

* Status as of 3/28/2013

What is the status of fixing bugs and implementing ideas with respect
to the SML code library?

- I'm in phase 1 of the plan.

- I'm currently back-porting changes to the publish.pl script to
  handle the following:

  - Use of file references relative to the containing file instead of
    to the document being published.

  - Use of ALL UPPER CASE for reserved words.

  - Addition of the 'DOCUMENT' marker.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Plan

This `plan' describes the order in which I plan to fix the bugs and
implement the ideas described here.

+ PHASE 1: Implement new library class.  The new library class will
  contain methods that perform reasoning functions across all the
  content of the library.  This is necessary to construct lists of
  allocations within the scope of a release.  This functionality will
  replace the old `include_related.pl' script.

+ PHASE 2: Implement new formatter class.  Port all document rendering
  functionality from the old code-base.  The reason for doing this
  first is efficiency.  I want to deprecate the old code base
  (publish.pl) so I only have to maintain the new one.

+ PHASE 3: Simplify SML Syntax by:

  + removing distinction between regions and environments.  These
    should simply all be divisions and use the `>>>' and `<<<' syntax
    for begin and end markers

  + change division ID syntax to be part of the division marker
    instead of an attribute within the division
    (i.e. >>>division.div-001).  This will simplify parsing.

  + removing the feature whereby a user can specify entity type in an
    include statement (i.e. include::problem:)

  + specifying an explicit syntax for separating preamble content from
    narrative content (i.e. ===).

+ PHASE 4: Implement reasoner logic to validate business rules more
  abstract than the ontology.conf can express. For instance, every
  functional requirement should be derived from one or more business
  requirements. (Reasoner.pm class using CLIPS)

+ PHASE 5: Re-implement parser using Marpa to improve maintainability
  and flexibility.

* Open Bugs

# next: 048

[ ] BUG-047 (ROUTINE) CSV values not available for lookup.  See
    sdd-tvs design baseline table.

[ ] BUG-046 (HIGH) Re-design Validation Logic - The parser should
    assume text is ~~invalid~~ until it is validated.  Text objects
    should have a 'valid' attribute set to 0 until the validate method
    sets it to 1.  Text classes that should exhibit this behavior
    include: block, element, division, document, fragment, library.

[ ] BUG-045 (HIGH) The keyword 'INCLUDE' conflicts with a semantic
    relationship between use cases in OMG UML v2.4.  We need the
    capability to capture 'include' relationships between use cases
    without conflicting with the 'INCLUDE' mechanism used to include
    one document structure inside another.

[ ] BUG-044 (ROUTINE) Establish return values for all methods.
    Several of my methods return ambiguous values.  This makes them
    difficult to test.  Ensure all methods have clearly defined return
    values.

[ ] BUG-043 (HIGH) Insert Function Broken - Parsing test file
    doc.0009.sml reveals the parser is not resolving insert elements
    correctly.  That test file contains 2 `insert::' statements and
    neither are getting resolved by the parser.

[ ] BUG-042 (HIGH) Footnotes in Tables - I recently changed the
    footnote syntax to be tied to the containing division.  This works
    well when the containing division is a section, but not when it is
    a table (or perhaps a figure or other non-section division).
    Perhaps in these unusual cases, I should allow explicit
    declaration of the footnote's division ID in ?

[ ] BUG-040 (ROUTINE) False Positive Cardinality Warnings - The new
    Parser.pm throws false positive cardinality warnings like "empty:0
    no cardinality for table-row outcome..."

[ ] BUG-038 (ROUTINE) Allocation and Assignment CSV Files Not
    Rendering - The publish.pl script is not producing allocation and
    assignment CSV files.  Well, it is creating them, but they are
    empty.

[ ] BUG-037 (LOW) Make Plural Certain Document Data Attributes -
    Certain document/parser attributes are complex data structures
    like footnote, outcome, review, table, and baretable.  These
    attribute names should reflect the plural nature of these
    attributes and should therefore be: footnotes, outcomes, reviews,
    tables, and baretables.  I think this will make the code more
    readable.

[ ] BUG-035 (MEDIUM) Entity Metadata not in Doc Order - The metadata
    of each entity enumerates other entities associated in various
    ways.  These associated entities should be listed in document
    order but they are not. (Where are they not listed in document
    order?)

[ ] BUG-031 (LOW) Images Not Published When All Are Figure Images - I
    think there is a deep logic error in image publishing.  When all
    document images are in figures, the images don't get published,
    thumb-nailed, or scaled.  Woody experiences this when he publishes
    a document containing only new and updated requirements.  I think
    the solution to this problem is to add logic between pass 2 and 3
    to publish images rather than publishing some images in pass 2 and
    some in pass 3.  You can work-around this problem by including a
    logo image.

[ ] BUG-030 (HIGH) Narrative Figures Dropped By Insert Mechanism -
    When you try to insert a narrative containing a figure, the figure
    doesn't get inserted.

[ ] BUG-029 (LOW) Listing A Raw SML Environment - How can I list the
    raw text of an SML environment without the parser interpreting the
    content as improperly nested environments?  Only by indenting it?

[ ] BUG-028 (HIGH) Regions Can't Be Nested - The current parser
    implementation doesn't allow nested regions.  While the need for
    nested regions is small at this point, it looks like fixing
    BUG-023 will require the parser to properly handle nested regions.

[ ] BUG-023 (MEDIUM) `Hide' and `Comment' Divisions Must Be Nestable -
    The current design and implementation does not allow hidden
    divisions or comment divisions to be nested.  this is dangerous
    because if you include a file containing a hidden division inside
    a hidden division, the `hide' tags conflict and you end up
    un-hiding content you meant to hide.  Similarly for comments, if a
    person accidentally puts one comment division inside another, the
    result will be unexpected.  Perhaps `hide' and `comment' should be
    regions?

[.] BUG-010 (HIGH) Publish::Parser::_gather_data needs to track table
    and baretable columns to recognize the end of a baretable

[ ] BUG-014 (LOW) HTML Header Covers Up Jumped-To Text After User
    Follows Hyperlink - When following a hyperlink in an HTML document
    with a header, the header covers up the first line of the text.
    This makes you wonder whether following the hyperlink took you to
    the right place and forces you to scroll after making the jump.
    This is inconvenient.  Is there a way to tell the browser to
    scroll the target of the hyperlink some distance below the top of
    the browser window? The Chrome browser places the jumped-to link
    in the middle of the window not at the bottom (making this bug
    mute).  I wish IE worked that way.

[ ] BUG-009 (MEDIUM) No Requirement For Logging Function - Create new
    requirement for logging functionality.  Log to screen, log to
    file...

[ ] BUG-007 (MEDIUM) Execution Directory Dependency - publish.pl must
    be executed in the directory containing the document being
    published (i.e. publish.pl doc.txt).  Design a method to execute
    from any directory (i.e. publish.pl docs/doc.txt).  One wrinkle in
    this is included files.  They are currently specified using a path
    relative to the main document file.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ideas for Improvement

# next: 038

[ ] IDEA-037 (ROUTINE) Remove Perl::Critic Tests to Separate File.  In
    preparation to distribute the code using a package manager like
    Dist::Zilla, remove the Perl::Critic test from individual class
    tests.  These are causing file not found problems anyway. (opened
    2014-12-20 by Don J)

[ ] IDEA-036 (HIGH) Distinguish Public and Private Attributes and
    Methods.  The purpose of distinguishing between public and private
    attributes and methods is to improve the readability and
    maintainability of modules and aid the process of documenting the
    public API.

[ ] IDEA-035 (ROUTINE) Capability to change attribute value based on
    date.  For instance, set an expiration date and a rule that says
    the status of an item is green if the expiration date is 4 months
    in the future, yellow if less than 4 months, and red if expired.

[ ] IDEA-034 (LOW) Implement a Request Tracker server on CSOCCM.  This
    could replace these cheesy TODO files with a better ticketing
    system.  RT has many advantages including: (1) the ability to
    allocate tickets to releases, (2) the ability to assign tickets to
    individuals. (But... perhaps I could use outlook instead?)

[ ] IDEA-033 (ROUTINE) Use absolute file paths for all cached file
    paths.  Doing so will avoid confusion over which directory you're
    in when later you go to use those files.

[ ] IDEA-031 (ROUTINE) Use Devel::Cover to report test coverage.

[ ] IDEA-030 (ROUTINE) Change division ID syntax.  Make the ID part of
    the syntax that begins a division rather than an element within
    the division.  This would simplify parsing. For instance:

    >>>DOCUMENT.frd-sml

    ---table.tab-001

[ ] IDEA-029 (ROUTINE) Automatically generate missing division IDs.
    Rather than requiring the user to provide an ID, automatically
    generate an ID.  Perhaps warn if no user-specified ID is present?
    The problem the user creates by not specifying an ID is he can't
    refer to the division.

[ ] IDEA-028 (HIGH) Implement Build Script for Individual Documents -
    Implement a script that builds an individual document.  By `build'
    I mean publish the document, check in the automatic changes made
    by the publisher, and repeat until there are no more uncommitted
    changes.  I have a build script for the entire library, but not
    for an individual document.

[ ] IDEA-026 (HIGH) Add `release' Property to Allocation - Add a
    `release' property to the semantics of an allocation entity.  This
    will enable us to automatically generate: (1) lists of allocated
    requirements within scope of a release, (2) lists of CIs impacted
    by a release, and (3) lists of test cases (apart from regression
    tests) that must be executed for a release.

[ ] IDEA-025 (ROUTINE) Investigate MARPA - Marpa is a new(ish)
    Lexing/Parsing library that is likely a better alternative than my
    hand-rolled lexer/parser
    code. (http://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS)

[ ] IDEA-024 (ROUTINE) Don't Use makeindex and makeglossary Scripts -
    The makeindex and makeglossary perl scripts come with MikTeX.
    They scan a LaTeX source file to create included index and
    glossary files.  Since glossary entries often include other
    glossary terms it takes many makeglossary passes to fully resolve
    all references.  I should have the publishing software write the
    index and glossary files directly so the PDF can be generated in a
    single pass.  This would be far more efficient than the current
    solution.

[ ] IDEA-022 (ROUTINE) Change `Footnotes' to just `Notes' - Rather
    than calling them `footnotes' the notes in my documents should
    simply be called `notes' because they could be rendered either as
    footnotes or as endnotes.

[ ] IDEA-020 (HIGH) Implement Generalization/Specialization
    Relationship - generalizes/specializes.

[ ] IDEA-019 (HIGH) Deprecate Parent/Child Relationship - Replace the
    (ambiguous) parent/child relationship with the part_of/part
    relationship.

[ ] IDEA-018 (HIGH) Get Rid Of Results - The idea of using a `result'
    entity as a container for outcomes is a bad idea because it
    introduces unnecessary complexity.  The idea that an outcome
    establishes the status of an entity is a ~~good~~ idea.  To
    simplify document maintenance, outcomes should go directly into
    the entities they describe.  How then do you tie an outcome to a
    test case (important for repeatability)?  Well, if outcomes become
    properties of entities, I could change the outcome syntax to
    replace the entity ID with the test case ID.

[ ] IDEA-017 (ROUTINE) Enable csv2tbl.pl To Select Rows - Update the
    csv2tbl.pl script to permit user to specify range of rows to
    include (-r 2-25). Dave Bristow requested this functionality.

[ ] IDEA-016 (ROUTINE) Indicate Separation of Preamble and Narrative -
    Remove ambiguity over the transition from preamble to narrative by
    requiring authors to insert markup that explicitly indicates the
    transition (===).  Absence of the transition indicates a division
    has no narrative content.

[ ] IDEA-015 (ROUTINE) Deprecate Division Types in `Includes' - The
    current implementation allows you to `include' the contents of a
    file as a `problem' division with `include::problem:'.  This
    should be deprecated.  My original thinking was to allow the
    flexibility to include the same content as different division
    types. I've never needed to, and this is practically impossible
    since different types have different preamble elements.
    Therefore, the design contains unnecessary complexity that I
    should remove.

[ ] IDEA-014 (ROUTINE) Title in HTML Navigation Margin - Render the
    document title at the top of the HTML left-margin navigation area.

[ ] IDEA-011 (ROUTINE) Formalize SML Document Library Implementation -
    SML should implement a formal `library' concept so it can operate
    on the library.  The library is a collection of documents.  The
    library should provide a catalog function that allows documents to
    be referenced by an identifier guaranteed to be unique within the
    library.  The unique document identifier could then be used in
    `include::' statements.  I'd like libraries to be distributable as
    well as localize-able.  In other words, I'd like a library to
    possibly be a collection of documents scattered across the web
    addressed by URI.

[ ] IDEA-009 (ROUTINE) Get Rid of Environments Altogether - Why not
    ~~just~~ use regions?  They are more powerful.  Changing existing
    environments (---table) into regions (>>>table) would simplify the
    language.  This would simplify parsing and rendering.  It would
    also make it more difficult to accidentally introduce document
    division `improper nesting' errors.

[ ] IDEA-008 (ROUTINE) Decide whether or not to substitute variables
    within pre-formatted text.  There are two forms of pre-formatted
    text: (1) text that is indented, and (2) text within a
    ---preformatted environment.  I ~~could~~ get tricky and
    substitute variables in one and not the other.  Tricky is usually
    not a good idea.  Perhaps the preformatted environment could have
    a property which determined whether or not variables within it
    should be substituted.

[.] IDEA-007 (ROUTINE) Deprecate use of [title:...],
    [description:...], [type:...], and [owner:...].  Replace with
    [lookup:title:...], [lookup:description:...], [lookup:type:...],
    [lookup:owner:...].

[ ] IDEA-006 (LOW) Namespaces For Variables - Should SML provide
    namespaces for variables?  Should a division provide a lexical
    namespace outside of which a variable declaration has no meaning?
    Would this harm anything?  This would be easy to implement.

[ ] CHANGE-005 (HIGH) Re-design Container File Change Triggering
    Mechanism - I don't like the current solution.  The current
    solution places an update-able field in the include statement
    (i.e. include:$r3765$: incl/my-file.txt) that reduces readability
    with those ugly dollar signs.  How about having a special division
    at the end of a document file that lists all included files and
    their current version?  What other types of automatic updates
    would be good to have?

    $$$included-file-revisions

    r4422 incl/glossary.txt
    r3985 incl/sources.txt

    $$$included-file-revisions

[ ] CHANGE-002 (ROUTINE) Change Property Names:

    epigraph text     => (use narrative rather than element)
    problem assignee  => problem assigned_to
    problem request   => problem requested_by
    problem effort    => problem requires_effort
    solution problem  => solution shall_solve
    solution assignee => solution assigned_to
    solution request  => solution requested_by
    test problem      => test verifies
    test solution     => test validates
    test assignee     => test assigned_to
    test request      => test requested_by
    result test       => result from_test
    result assignee   => result assigned_to
    task assignee     => task assigned_to
    problem parent    => problem specializes
    problem child     => problem generalizes

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Requested Features

# next: 021

[ ] FEATURE-021 (ROUTINE) Enable Cross Reference Scope - Re-design
    cross references so they can be used within two different scopes:
    (1) within a document, or (2) within a library.  An ID may not be
    unique within a library but must be unique within a
    document. (opened 2015-02-22 by Don J)

[ ] FEATURE-020 (ROUTINE) Simple Functional-to-Technical Requirement
    Mapping - Woody would like the capability to generate a simple
    mapping of functional requirements to technical requirements.  I
    think this is may be a new `generated content' type.

[ ] FEATURE-019 (HIGH) Implement property inheritance from
    generalization items to specialization items.  Before implementing
    this feature, transition parent/child relationships to
    part-of/has-part relationships to avoid confusion.

[.] FEATURE-014 (HIGH) Requirements Validation Function - Implement a
    function to validate that requirements conform to requirements
    definition business rules. For instance, all requirements have one
    of six required types: (1) mission directive, (2) compliance
    directive, (3) business requirement, (4) functional requirement,
    (5) non-functional requirement, or (6) system requirement.  This
    feature is unique to the Vetting Operations Engineering Library
    and therefore should be implemented as a utility and not baked
    into the SML software library.

[.] FEATURE-004 (LOW) Update SML syntax to allow includes of variant
    `section' to be written like `** include:
    incl/my-included-section.txt'. This way I can still use Emacs'
    outline mode to see the complete section structure of a
    document. (implemented in v2 but not in v1)

[.] FEATURE-011 (LOW) Separate Header/Footer From Preamble - Define
    header and footer environments instead of putting header and
    footer attributes in document preamble. (implemented in v2 but not
    v1)  This will allow different headers/footers in different parts
    of a document.

[ ] FEATURE-010 (LOW) In glossary definitions, the presence of a
    context indicator like (IEEE) impairs the re-usability of the
    definition in non-glossary text.  Find a way to express glossary
    definitions that allows the source context to be presented in the
    glossary but not in definition re-use.

[ ] FEATURE-009 (LOW) Conditional inline elements [?...].  For
    instance (1) only insert a page number if rendering PDF, (2) only
    insert link to item if item exists, (3) only insert item type if
    item *has* a type.

[ ] FEATURE-008 (MEDIUM) Define iterative template syntax and then
    implement Parser.pm capability to resolve iterative templates.

[ ] FEATURE-006 (MEDIUM) Design multiple methods for finding included
    files.  Ideas include (1) relative to main document, (2) INCDIR
    array, (3) ID lookup in library file, (4) URI/URL. See also
    IDEA-011.

[ ] FEATURE-003 (LOW) Implement document epigraph feature to put an
    epigraph on the title page of a document. Woody tried to use this
    an found out it wasn't yet implemented.

[ ] FEATURE-002 (MEDIUM) Create the ability to read CI attributes in
    from a CSV file.  I think there may be two variations of this.
    The first is where all the attributes in a CSV file pertains to
    the same CI.  The second is where they may pertain to multiple
    CIs.

[ ] FEATURE-001 (MEDIUM) PDF rendition traceability matrices. Generate
    traceability matrices for the PDF rendition similar to the HTML
    rendition.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Closed Bugs

[X] BUG-041 (HIGH) Parser Can't Resolve Variable(s) in BRD - For some
    unexplained reason, a current Business Requirements Document (BRD)
    causes the Parser to enter an infinite loop because it can't
    substitute a variable.  The parser eventually EXCEEDS MAX
    ITERATIONS and bails out.  The line that doesn't resolve is a
    table cell line: ":r: [var:fcm-count][f:tab-subj-populations:3]"
    (closed 2012-10-10 by drj)

[X] BUG-033 (ROUTINE) Don't Display Empty Revision/Version Numbers -
    In the baseline summaries a bare `v' and `r' appear in the left
    margin for version and rendition, but with no number.  If there is
    no number to render, don't render the `v' and the `r'. (closed
    2012-09-30 by drj)

[X] BUG-001 (MEDIUM) Incorrect HTML Top-Level Book Section Names -
    Top-level book sections should always be `Chapter' but in the HTML
    rendition they are not. (closed 2012-09-30 by drj)

[X] BUG-002 (LOW) Incorrect HTML Front-matter Section Name Case - In
    front-matter lists section types (section, chapter, appendix)
    should be ucfirst. (closed 2012-09-30 by drj)

[X] BUG-003 (MEDIUM) Incorrect HTML Appendix Numbering - In HTML
    rendition, appendix numbers should be letters, not
    numbers. (closed 2012-09-30 by drj)

[X] BUG-039 (HIGH) Default Section Not Handled - After the document
    preamble but before the first section heading (if there is one) is
    a part of the document that should be handled as a ``default
    section.''  The parser must be updated to recognize the end of the
    document preamble to infer the beginning of this default
    section. (closed 2012-09-21 by drj)

[X] BUG-036 (HIGH) Back Port Footnote Syntax Change - I made a change
    to the syntax of footnotes necessary in the v2.0 codebase.  Back
    port it to the v1.0 codebase so the documents remain in
    sync. (closed 2012-09-15 by drj)

[X] BUG-034 (MEDIUM) Fix Cardinality Error in render_tree and
    render_tree_row - The `render_tree' and `render_tree_row'
    subroutines in publish.pl assume that ALL column values have
    cardinality of `many'.  This is a bad assumption.  Fix these
    subroutines the same way I fixed the `render_matrix' subroutine --
    check each value whether it is an ARRAY or a SCALAR. (closed
    2012-03-02 by drj)

[X] BUG-005 (MEDIUM) Incorrect Tree View Test Case Order - In tree
    view test cases should appear in the order they occur in the
    document.  The current implementation sorts them in ascending
    `label' order.  This problem is the same across all item types,
    not just test cases. (closed 2012-02-22 by drj)

[X] BUG-032 (HIGH) Lookup Table Cell Color-as-Status Broken - I think
    when I converted element names from using single to double colons
    I broke this feature used to colorize the baseline
    summaries. (closed 2012-02-01 by drj)

[X] BUG-006 (HIGH) `Include' Mechanism Not Fully Implemented In
    Parser.pm - Implement and test the 6 `include' variations in
    Parser.pm. (as-is, flat, section, region, hide, raw) (closed
    2011-12-14 by drj)

[X] BUG-027 (HIGH) Parser Does Not Ignore Elements Within Comments -
    Users should have the capability to `comment out' elements and the
    parser should ignore them.  The current implementation is throwing
    warnings about unknown UNIVERSAL properties within comment
    divisions. (closed 2011-11-11 by drj)

[X] BUG-026 (HIGH) Output Of `script' Statements Not Going Into
    Document - Part 13 of Parser.t tests this function using
    doc.10.sml. (closed 2011-11-11 by drj)

[X] BUG-025 (HIGH) Listing And Pre-formatted Narratives Should Be
    Single Blocks That Span Any Newlines - The current parser
    implementation recognizes newlines within listing and
    pre-formatted narratives as the end of blocks.  It shouldn't.  The
    narrative of a listings, pre-formatted divisions, and comment
    divisions should be single blocks that only end at the end of the
    listing, pre-formatted division, or comment division. (closed
    2011-11-11 by drj)

[X] BUG-024 (HIGH) Listing Division Content Blocks Must Preserve
    Newlines - SML::Block->content method removes whitespace,
    compresses whitespace, and removes newlines.  This should ~~not~~
    happen for blocks withing listings or pre-formatted divisions.
    Perhaps each block should know whether it should be pre-formatted
    or not. (closed 2011-11-11 by drj)

[X] BUG-004 (MEDIUM) SML::Document::as_text Method Includes Comments -
    The $doc->as_text method should NOT render comments, hidden text,
    or conditional text for which the condition is not true. (closed
    2011-10-30 by drj - created new method `as_sml' to render as SML)

[X] BUG-022 (MEDIUM) Methods The Check For Unresolved Items Must
    Ignore Comment Contents - Each method that checks for unresolved
    items in a document must ignore those items if the occur within
    comments. (closed 2011-10-27 by drj)

[X] BUG-021 (MEDIUM) SML::Parser::_resolve_includes Does Not Ignore
    Include Statements Within Comment Divisions - The parser should
    ignore include statements inside comment divisions.  The current
    implementation does ~~not~~ do this. (closed 2011-10-27 by drj)

[X] BUG-020 (MEDIUM) SML::Parser::_run_scripts Does Not Ignore Script
    Statements Within Comment Divisions - The parser should ignore
    script statements inside comment divisions.  The current
    implementation does ~~not~~ do this. (closed 2011-10-27 by drj)

[X] BUG-019 (MEDIUM) SML::Parser::_resolve_conditionals Does Not
    Ignore Conditionals Within Comment Divisions - The parser should
    ignore conditional divisions inside comment divisions.  The
    current implementation does ~~not~~ do this. (closed 2011-10-27 by
    drj)

[X] BUG-018 (HIGH) SML::Parser::parsefile Missing Function To Resolve
    Conditionals - The parsefile method lacks functionality to resolve
    conditionals.  Update the ad-parsefile.vsd activity diagram and
    the parsefile method to implement. (closed 2011-10-26 by drj)

[X] BUG-008 (MEDIUM) Unnecessary Division Parsing Complexity -
    Collapse the number of Parser.pm `enter' and `exit' subroutines.
    Too many.  Pass an argument instead? Why use ~~both~~ end_element
    and exit_element?  Can't I consolidate these?  The same question
    goes for end_environment and exit_environment. (closed 2011-10-26
    by drj)

[X] BUG-017 (MEDIUM) Warnings Notification Missing - The application
    fails to notify the user that the document contains warnings.  I
    just published brd-o-and-m.txt and many warning displayed in the
    terminal but the rendered HTML document does not display the red
    `WARNINGS' link.  The publish.warnings.txt file ~~does~~ contain
    the warnings.  The problem turned out to be that only ~~certain~~
    warnings, lookup failures performed by the escape_html subroutine,
    were not getting reported at all.  Fixed now. (closed 2011-10-23
    by drj)

[X] BUG-011 (LOW) Runtime Status Messages Not On Own Line - Runtime
    error, warning, and changes message should appear on their own
    line for readability.  The current implementation prints these
    messages inline with no newlines and this makes them difficult to
    read. (closed 2011-10-23 by drj)

[X] BUG-016 (HIGH) Publish Application Detects Included Files As
    Modified When They Are Not - The current implementation of
    publish.pl assumes that the files that make up a document do not
    change during publishing.  This is a bad assumption since the
    `script:' feature can re-generate included files during
    publishing.  The program should check the change-control
    (currently SVN) status ~~after~~ all files are written to
    determine only at that time whether there are any uncommitted
    changes. This problem results in the publisher naming files
    `-MODIFIED' when they are not.  This is very confusing. (closed
    2011-10-23 by drj)

[X] BUG-015 (MEDIUM) HTML Revisions Listing Is Misplaced - The HTML
    Revisions listing should be on a page by itself.  But there's a
    bug in publish.pl that puts the revision listing at the top of the
    last HTML file produced by the program making it difficult to find
    and munging that last page. (closed 2011-10-23 by drj)

[X] BUG-013 (HIGH) Replacement Glossary Definitions Of Terms
    Containing Ampersands Is Broken - The publish.pl program throws a
    warning when it encounters a statement like [def:ST&E] because
    earlier code replaced the `&' with `\&'.  This means the publish
    application throws a warning when it shouldn't. (closed 2011-10-23
    by drj)

* Implemented Changes

[X] IDEA-032 (ROUTINE) Use Perl::Critic to evaluate Perl code against
    best practices.  Investigate the use of Test::Perl::Critic to
    integrate Perl::Critic into test programs. (closed 2013-03-31 by
    drj)

[X] IDEA-027 (HIGH) Implement NOSVN Option - Implement an option that
    disables all SVN functionality during publishing.  I have a theory
    that gathering SVN data is the primary performance drain on the
    publishing process. (closed 2012-10-21 by drj)

[X] IDEA-023 (ROUTINE) Divisions Don't Need `lines' Attribute - Since
    divisions are composed of blocks and blocks are composed of lines,
    divisions don't need to also keep track of their lines.  If I need
    to get the first line of a division, I can just get the first line
    of the first block. Dropping the `lines' attribute from the
    division class should improve performance. Is there any reason for
    a document to have a lines attribute?  What about for the purpose
    of writing changes back out to original SML files? (closed
    2012-09-25 by drj)

[X] IDEA-021 (ROUTINE) Use SML Engineering Docs for Tests - Move SML
    FRD, SDD, TED, and UG under the test directory (/t) and use them
    for regression testing.  I'm getting to the point in the
    implementation where I need very complex documents against which
    to test functionality.  The SML Engineering Documents (FRD, SDD,
    TED, and UG) would be ideal for this purpose. (closed 2012-09-18
    by drj)

[X] IDEA-013 (HIGH) Promote Allocation to ID'd Division - An
    `allocation' needs to be a first-class object addressable by its
    own ID because test results need to be traceable to allocations
    instead of to requirements.  Since requirements are designed to be
    re-usable they may be satisfied in one context but not in others.
    For instance, suppose two CIs must satisfy the same requirement
    like a security requirement. If one CI satisfies the requirement
    and the other doesn't test results must capture these facts.
    Tests therefore must be traceable to allocations and not to
    requirements. (closed 2012-03-02 by drj)

[X] IDEA-012 (ROUTINE) Allow Comments At The End Of Elements - SML
    should allow authors to place comments at the end of element
    lines.  For instance, instead of `stakeholder:: ro-000022' the
    author ought to have the ability to put `stakeholder:: ro-000022 #
    system owner.'  Currently this throws and error. (closed
    2012-03-02 by drj)

[X] IDEA-010 (ROUTINE) Cache Templates In Memory - Rather than reading
    template files over and over again, cache them in memory. (closed
    2011-12-28 by drj)

[X] CHANGE-001 (ROUTINE) Change Element Name Syntax From Single To
    Double Colon - The use of only a single colon conflicts with a
    significant number of instances where the plain text contains a
    word at the beginning of a line with a colon.  So, instead of a
    title element being `title: My Title' it will be `title:: My
    Title'. (closed 2011-11-08 by drj)

[X] CHANGE-004 (ROUTINE) Collect Blocks In Sets By Division - Collect
    the sequence of blocks that make up a division and assign the
    block set to the division at the end of the division.  This will
    provide the ability to process all block in a division. (closed
    2011-11-11 by drj)

[X] CHANGE-003 (ROUTINE) Process Blocks Rather Than Lines - Wherever
    possible, process blocks (even divisions?) instead of lines to (1)
    recognize inline markup that might span a line boundary, and (2)
    improve performance. (closed 2011-11-11 by drj)

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Implemented Features

[X] FEATURE-012 (MEDIUM) `Include Related' Script Should Provide
    Section Outline Option - the `include_related.pl' script should
    provide an option that creates a section structure for large
    listings of items.  This will make large collections of related
    items easier to navigate. (closed 2012-02-29 by drj)

[X] FEATURE-007 (HIGH) Implement Parser.pm capability to resolve
    templates. (closed 2011-12-14 by drj)

[X] FEATURE-005 (HIGH) Implement initial template mechanism using the
    `include:id=my-id' syntax.  Migrate later to
    `template:id=my-id'. (closed 2011-12-05 by drj)

[X] FEATURE-015 (HIGH) Define Ontology In ontology.conf Rather Than
    SML.pm - Rather than "hard-coding" the default SML ontology in the
    SML.pm class, define it in a configuration file, preferably in the
    sml.conf file. (closed 2011-11-25 by drj)

[X] FEATURE-016 (ROUTINE) Make Log Messages Pretty - Log messages
    meant for users should not contain the name of the subroutine
    emitting the message, only debugging message.  Customize logging
    to NOT contain information users aren't interested in above the
    DEBUG level. (closed 2011-11-25 by drj)

[X] FEATURE-018 (ROUTINE) Implement Subscript Syntax - Use double
    commas to indicate subscripts (i.e. precision,,max,,) (closed
    2011-11-25 by drj)

[X] FEATURE-017 (ROUTINE) Implement Superscript Syntax - Use double
    circumflexes to indicate superscripts (i.e. y^^x-1^^) (closed
    2011011025 by drj)

[X] FEATURE-013 (MEDIUM) Provide Links To ERRORS, WARNINGS, and
    CHANGES In HTML Rendition - The purpose of this feature is to
    notify authors that errors, warnings, and/or change messages were
    generated by the publishing application.  If a document contains
    errors, warnings, or uncommitted changes in included files,
    display a link in the left margin that provides easy access to
    these messages. (implemented 2011-10-23 by drj)
