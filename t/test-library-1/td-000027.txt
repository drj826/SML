title:: INVALID Glossary Term Reference

This SML document illustrates an example of an ~~INVALID~~ glossary
term reference.  The reference is invalid because the term defined in
the glossary is lower case but the reference is looking for a
title-cased term.

The [g:Functional Requirement]s for the system are specified in the
Functional Requirements Document.

glossary:: functional requirement = A requirement that describes what
a system or system component must ~~do~~ for a user.  Functional
requirements begin with the phrase, ``The system shall enable...''
Functional requirements are derived from business requirements.
