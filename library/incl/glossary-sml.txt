glossary:: shall statement {sml} = (SML) A definitive statement of a
requirement.  Requirements are meant to communicate needs between
stakeholders and solution providers. Requirements should be easy to
understand for users and solution providers. One common way to
document a system requirement is stating what the system ~~shall~~
do. See also [g:sml:use case]

glossary:: slide {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:region] that describes the
content of a presentation slide that an instructor might use to teach
a class

glossary:: solution {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:region] that describes the
solution to a problem.  A solution is an [g:sml:entity]

glossary:: source {sml} = (SML) An [g:sml:environment] that describes a
cite-able bibliographic source

glossary:: special feature {sml} = (SML) A feature that enables
document authors to minimize the maintenance burden of updating
documents and to automate certain document content generation

glossary:: structure {sml} = (SML) The way content is organized.  A
type of markup feature used to ~~organize~~ [g:sml:document]
content. For example: sentences, paragraphs, [g:sml:section]
hierarchies, [g:sml:table]s, [g:sml:figure]s, [g:sml:listing]s

glossary:: system component {sml} = (SML) Any discrete item that is
part of a system or subsystem

glossary:: system requirement {sml} = (SML) A requirement that
describes what a system must ~~do~~ or ~~be~~.  Vetting Operations
engineering uses three types of system requirements: [g:sml:functional
requirement]s, [g:sml:non-functional requirement]s, and
[g:sml:technical requirement]s

glossary:: systems engineering {sml} = (SML) The interdisciplinary
approach governing the total technical and managerial effort required
to transform a set of customer needs, expectations, and constraints
into a product solution and support that solution throughout the
product's life. This includes the definition of technical performance
measures, the integration of engineering specialties towards the
establishment of a product architecture, and the definition of
supporting life-cycle processes that balance cost, performance, and
schedule objectives.

glossary:: table {sml} = (SML) An [g:sml:environment] that instructs
the publishing application to insert a table into the document.
Tables can include titles and descriptions (i.e., captions)

glossary:: task {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:region] that represents a task,
a unit of work to be performed.  A task is an [g:sml:entity]

glossary:: technical requirement {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:requirement]
that describes something a [g:ieee:system] must ~~do~~ to support
another system function.  Note the difference between a ~~technical
requirement~~ and a ~~[g:sml:functional requirement]~~.  A ~~technical
requirement~~ describes what the system must do for another
[g:ieee:system] or [g:sml:system component].  A ~~functional
requirement~~ describes what the system must do for a ~~user~~.
Technical requirements begin with the phrase, ``The system shall...''
Technical requirements may be implementation specific/dependent. See
also DHS definition of [g:sml:system requirement].  Technical
requirements are derived from [g:sml:functional requirement]s and
[g:sml:non-functional requirement]s.

glossary:: template {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:fragment] that represents a
reusable division of document [g:sml:structure] the [g:sml:content] of
which is filled-in via [g:sml:variable definition], [g:sml:attribute
definition], and/or [g:sml:glossary definition] substitution

glossary:: test {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:region] that describes a test, a
method of proving a solution solves a problem.  A test is an
[g:sml:entity]

glossary:: text {sml} = (SML) A string of 7-bit ASCII encoded
characters, any length, may contain white space characters (space,
tab, newline).  See also [g:sml:inline], [g:sml:markup] and
[g:sml:content]

glossary:: title {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:block] that is a brief name,
description, or heading of a [g:sml:document], [g:sml:environment],
[g:sml:region], [g:sml:entity], or [g:sml:section]

glossary:: unit test {sml} = (SML) The lowest level of automated test,
often called an ``assertion,'' that tests a single program function or
configuration for expected success or failure

glossary:: unit test case {sml} = (SML) (1) An automated, repeatable
[g:ieee:test case] containing [g:sml:unit test]s; (2) A unit test case
description file that uniquely identifies and describes a unit test
case and serves to establish traceability between unit test cases,
test results, configuration items, and requirements.  A unit test case
traces to a single test result file

glossary:: use case {sml} = (SML) A technique for capturing functional
requirements of business systems and, potentially, of an IT system to
support the business system.  The use case model uses ``Actors'' and
``use cases.'' An Actor is the representation of a person or system
which exists outside the system under study and who (or which)
performs a sequence of activities in a dialog with the system.  A Use
Case represents a single interaction between a primary actor (who
initiates the interaction) and other (secondary) actors, and the
system itself. The interaction is presented as a sequence of simple
steps

glossary:: variable definition {sml} = (SML) A [g:sml:definition] that
defines a key/value pair where the key is the variable name and the
value is the definition.  Variable definitions are limited to a single
block of text

glossary:: video {sml} = (SML) An [g:sml:environment] that instructs
the publishing application to insert a video clip into the document
