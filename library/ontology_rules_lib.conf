#
#     The ontology rules defined in this configuration file are
#     specifically designed to represent systems engineering
#     documentation using terms like: requirement, solution, test, result,
#     task, and role.
#
#     An ontology is an explicit formal specification of terms to
#     represent the entities defined in some area of interest, the
#     relationships that hold among them, and the formal axioms that
#     constrain the interpretation and well-formed use of these terms.
#
#     field definitions:
#
#     1. rule          = rule ID
#     2. type          = rule type
#                          cls = class rule
#                          prp = property rule
#                          enu = enumerated value rule
#                          cmp = composition rule
#     3. entity        = type of entity on which rule operates, all upper-case
#                        denotes reserved name
#                          UNIVERSAL = applies anywhere
#     4. property name = name of property
#     5. object type   = type of property object
#     6. name/value    = name of property object or value of enumerated allowed
#                        property value
#     7. inverse       = inverse inference rule ID
#     8. card          = cardinality
#                          cls rules => how many allowed in document
#                          prp rules => how many allowed in class
#     9. rq            = required property? (boolean)
#    10. im            = imply only? (boolean) if yes, document may not directly
#                        declare this property, it may only be inferred from the
#                        inverse rule

#
#     Don't change these rules unless you really know what you're
#     doing.  One or more documentation libraries may be tightly
#     coupled to the rules defined in this ontology.  Changing these
#     rules may INVALIDATE library documents which could cause
#     significant effort to correct.
