description:: The data format shall minimize document
[g:sml:presentation] markup.  The purpose of this requirement is to
allow a manuscript to be automatically published in multiple
renditions and to limit authors capability to adjust presentation. In
other words, ~~deny~~ authors the ability to specify the ~~style~~ or
~~appearance~~ of their content.

The reason the data format must primarily represent elements of
content and structure but minimize representation of presentation
elements is to help authors focus on creating content instead of
wasting time fiddling with document presentation.  Modern documents
are often published to multiple formats and authors often do not
control how their content is presented to readers.
