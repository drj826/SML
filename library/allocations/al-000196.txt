outcome::2011-11-27:al-000196:red: I rate the SML library's
re-usability as red because the current implementation has all the
code in a single script.  The parser and the renderer are all together
so that you cannot perform parsing and rendering functions
independently.  The code must be modularized to enable re-use of
independent functions.
