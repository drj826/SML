description:: The Baretable.pm module implements the SML::Baretable
class.  An SML baretable environment instructs the publishing
application to insert a baretable into the document.  Baretables are
special.  They don't have begin and end tags and they don't have a
preamble.  A baretable begins with the beginning of a table cell that
isn't in a table and ends with the beginning of a block that (1) isn't
a table cell, and (2) where column = 0 (i.e. immediately following the
end of a row).
