* Introduction

type:: chapter

This is the Functional Requirements Document (FRD) for a ~~structured
manuscript data format~~.  The required data format will be used to
represent book, article, and report manuscripts that will be published
to multiple document renditions by a publishing application.

Intended applications of this data format include: (1) requirements
documentation, (2) design documentation, (3) test documentation, (4)
training documentation, and (5) project plans.

The overarching purpose of the data format is to enable authors to
create modular, re-usable documents and document fragments they can
automatically publish to multiple different renditions.  Authors
shouldn't have to re-write the same information twice.  Therefore they
need the capability to combine and re-use fragments of documents to
create whole documents.

Why call it a ``structured manuscript'' data format?

The term ~~structured~~ implies information can be modularly organized
and can contain predefined relationships.

A ~~manuscript~~ contains manually created written information.  The
term implies it is the ~~original~~ version as opposed to a duplicated
or published version.

The concept of a ``structured manuscript'' aligns well with the
overarching purpose to enable authors to create modular, re-usable
documents and document fragments they can automatically publish to
multiple different document renditions.
